          <p>Feel free to play around with different shapes, styles, or symbols in your writing and see what results you get. You may notice that the AI has a hard time reading what you wrote — in particular, it seems to favor certain shapes of symbols, and punctuation doesn't go well with it. This is because of a <b>lack of training data</b>.</p>
          <p><i style="font-size: 0.81em;text-align: center;color: #ffe1de">Here's a tip — try writing in <span class='bubble'>bubble text.</span></i></p>
          <p>The type of artificial intelligence used here is known as a convolutional neural network, or <b>CNN</b>. CNNs utilize a not-uncommon technique known as <i>machine learning</i> to maximize favorable output for a set of inputs. In particular, computer scientists design a CNN by feeding it a large set of data, called the training set, mapping it to desired outputs, and then 'training' the model by using multivariate calculus to optimize weights and biases.</p>
          <p>With images, however, it gets a little more complicated. For one, the AI is fed the entire image pixel by pixel, which results in a lot of input data. This could range from hundreds to millions of nodes being fed into the AI. What is the result? Well, for one, calculations will take much longer. There are efforts by AI researchers such as Michaël Gharbi, LiXia Xue and Yuanping Zhu to improve the efficiency and speed of image-processing AI using various creative techniques, such as splitting it up into lighter parts or using the AI to instead train a separate algorithm that does the processing for it!</p>
          <p>Here, the canvas is 480×480 pixels, for a total of 230,400 pixels. These pixels are fed directly into the AI when you click the button; in this case, it takes around one tenth of a second to compute. Compare this to the large, 4K-quality images that a phone camera would produce — which often come with ready-made filters to try. This disparity creates a large demand for efficient image processing, which is why the development of AI-based processing is prominent today.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before, the AI here uses a convolutional neural network to identify the handwriting. This is no accident: CNNs are useful for their accuracy and straightforwardness when used well, but they have some major faults. For one, the usefulness of a CNN heavily depends on its training dataset. If the data shows bias, the CNN will too; not enough data, and the AI will be inaccurate, like the example here is. Furthermore, providing <i>too</i> much data could even cause it to memorize its dataset and provide inaccurate results once again. CNNs are also known for their large memory and processing power usage compared to other types of AI. So, what can we do? Well, researchers have already asked this question, and are exploring other methods for image-based processing including things like multi-path feedback fusion networks (MFFN) and residual dense networks (RDN), which are both lighter and more accurate alternatives for graphics processing. Some instead choose to focus on the utility of the AI, seeking to accomplish greater tasks like reconstructing super-resolution images. In all, the choice of AI is important to the task, making it a major consideration in modern research.</p>
          <p>While AI is shown here as an example of its utility in 'seeing' images, it certainly doesn't end at reading handwriting. AI has many uses you probably wouldn't think of — vision in robotics, for one, or reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D photographs. These could both be accomplished by CNNs, but researchers today are employing much more thoughtful techniques to solve them — one involves turning the image into 3D cubes. Isn't that neat?</p>
          <p>In all, when we think of the intersection of artificial intelligence and computer images, we probably think of algorithms and image recognition, but in truth the connection extends far beyond that. AI is useful in many extensions of computer graphics, and its use isn't limited to being 'an algorithm.' Rather, the way it's used today goes to show us that no matter how simple or complex the problem, there's a creative solution waiting somewhere.</p>
